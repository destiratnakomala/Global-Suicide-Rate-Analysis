# Accenture Data Analytics and Visualization 

This is the Accenture Data Analytics virtual experience project with Forage. The goal was to help a company named "Social Buzz" leverage the use of its massive amount of data. Social Buzz has reached a huge scale in recent years to become recognized as a global unicorn company. At Accenture, we have embarked on a 3-month pilot to help tackle their biggest challenges on 3 main tasks:

1- Audit of Social Buzz big data practice

2- Implimentation of an IPO

3- Analysis of the top 5 popular categories of content

### `In short, the client wanted to see “An analysis of their content categories showing the top 5 categories with the largest popularity”.`
