# Cyberbullying Tweet Prediction

## Overview
Cyberbullying has become a prevalent issue in online platforms, affecting individuals' mental health and well-being. This project aims to address this problem by developing machine learning models capable of identifying cyberbullying content in tweets. By accurately detecting such content, we can take proactive measures to mitigate the harmful effects of cyberbullying and create a safer online environment.

## Dataset Information
The dataset used in this project comprises tweets collected from various social media platforms, including Twitter. Each tweet is labeled as either containing cyberbullying content or not. Additionally, the dataset may include features such as user information, timestamps, and metadata associated with each tweet. Understanding the characteristics of the dataset is crucial for effectively preprocessing the data and building robust prediction models.

### Data Structure:
The dataset typically consists of the following structure:

- **Text**: The actual content of the tweet, which serves as the primary input for our prediction models.
- **Label**: Binary indicator representing whether the tweet contains cyberbullying content (1) or not (0).

## Methodologies
This project adopts a comprehensive approach that encompasses various methodologies to achieve the desired outcome:

1. **Data Collection and Exploration**:
   - Gathering a diverse and representative dataset of tweets containing both cyberbullying and non-cyberbullying content.
   - Exploratory data analysis (EDA) to gain insights into the distribution of cyberbullying tweets, identify patterns, and understand the underlying characteristics of the data.

2. **Data Preprocessing**:
   - Text cleaning and preprocessing techniques to remove noise, such as special characters, URLs, and emojis.
   - Tokenization to break down the text into individual words or tokens.
   - Removing stopwords and applying techniques like stemming or lemmatization to standardize the text data.

3. **Feature Engineering**:
   - Extracting relevant features from the text data using techniques such as TF-IDF (Term Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency) or word embeddings (e.g., Word2Vec, GloVe).
   - Encoding categorical variables and transforming them into numerical representations suitable for machine learning models.

4. **Model Building**:
   - Utilizing various machine learning algorithms, including logistic regression, random forest, support vector machines (SVM), and deep learning models like recurrent neural networks (RNNs) or convolutional neural networks (CNNs).
   - Hyperparameter tuning to optimize the performance of the models and avoid overfitting.

5. **Model Evaluation**:
   - Assessing the performance of the trained models using evaluation metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, and area under the ROC curve (AUC-ROC).
   - Conducting cross-validation to validate the robustness of the models and ensure their generalization to unseen data.

6. **Deployment**:
   - Deploying the best-performing model as a web application using frameworks like Flask or Django.
   - Providing users with an intuitive interface to interact with the model, allowing them to input text and receive predictions on whether the input contains cyberbullying content.

## Deployment
To deploy the model and related files, follow these steps:

1. **Clone the Repository**: 
   ```
   git clone <repository_url>
   ```
   Replace `<repository_url>` with the URL of the repository.

2. **Navigate to the Deployment Directory**: 
   ```
   cd deployment
   ```

3. **Install Dependencies**: 
   ```
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```
   This command installs all the required dependencies specified in the `requirements.txt` file.

4. **Run the Application**: 
   - Ensure that Python and all required dependencies are installed.
   - Run `app.py` using Python:
     ```
     python app.py
     ```

   This will start the application locally, and you can access it through your web browser.
