## Objective
The primary objective of this project is to perform clustering modeling to segment credit card customers based on their behavior and other supporting factors. By grouping customers with similar behavior together, the credit card company aims to develop optimal and focused business strategies to enhance revenue.

## Methodology
1. **Data Preprocessing**:
   - Handle missing values.
   - Encode categorical variables if necessary.
   - Scale numerical features.

2. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**:
   - Explore distributions of features.
   - Identify patterns and trends in the data.

3. **Customer Segmentation**:
   - Implement the K-Means clustering algorithm.
   - Determine the optimal number of clusters using the elbow method and silhouette score.
   - Perform clustering based on relevant features.

4. **Interpretation and Insights**:
   - Analyze the characteristics of each customer segment.
   - Identify actionable insights for targeted marketing and product offerings.

## Conclusion
Customer segmentation through clustering analysis provides valuable insights into credit card customer behavior. By understanding the distinct segments within their customer base, the credit card company can tailor their marketing strategies, product offerings, and customer service initiatives to better meet the needs and preferences of each segment, ultimately leading to increased customer satisfaction and revenue.

## Future Work
- Explore other clustering algorithms to compare performance.
- Incorporate additional demographic or transactional data for more comprehensive segmentation.
- Implement real-time clustering for dynamic customer segmentation.
