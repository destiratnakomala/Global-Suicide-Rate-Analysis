# Customer Churn Prediction

## Overview
This project focuses on predicting customer churn using deep learning frameworks. The objective is to develop a classification model that can predict whether a customer will stop using the company's product (churn) or not. By identifying customers at risk of churn, the company can implement targeted strategies to retain them and minimize revenue loss.

## Dataset Information
The dataset contains information about customer churn risk and various demographic, temporal, and behavioral factors, including:

- **Churn Risk Score**: Indicator of customer churn risk (0 for not churn, 1 for churn).
- **Demographic Factors**: Age, gender.
- **Temporal Factors**: Joined through referral, last visit time.
- **Customer Behavior**: User ID, region category, membership category, joining date, preferred offer types, medium of operation, internet option, days since last login, average time spent, average transaction value, average frequency login days, points in wallet, used special discount, offer application preference, past complaint, complaint status, feedback.

## Objective
The company aims to minimize the risk of customer churn by building a classification model to predict whether a customer will churn or not. This will enable the company to implement targeted business strategies to retain at-risk customers effectively.

## Methodology
1. **Data Preprocessing**:
   - Handle missing values.
   - Encode categorical variables.
   - Scale numerical features.
   - Split the dataset into training and testing sets.

2. **Model Building**:
   - Develop a deep learning model using frameworks like TensorFlow or PyTorch.
   - Define the model architecture with input, hidden, and output layers.
   - Compile the model with an appropriate loss function and optimizer.
   - Train the model on the training dataset and validate it on the testing dataset.
   - Optimize hyperparameters and architecture to improve performance.

3. **Model Evaluation**:
   - Evaluate the model using appropriate metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.
   - Validate the model's performance using cross-validation techniques.
   - Analyze the model's predictions and identify areas for improvement.

4. **Deployment**:
   - Deploy the trained model using a Flask web application.
   - Provide an interface for users to input customer data and receive churn predictions.
   - Monitor the model's performance in real-time and update it as needed.

## Conclusion
Predicting customer churn is crucial for businesses to implement proactive measures to retain valuable customers. By leveraging deep learning frameworks, the company can develop accurate churn prediction models and deploy them for real-time predictions. This enables the company to focus resources on retaining customers at risk of churn, ultimately improving customer retention and revenue.

## Future Work
- Explore ensemble learning techniques to improve model performance.
- Incorporate additional features or external data sources to enhance prediction accuracy.
- Conduct A/B testing to evaluate the effectiveness of retention strategies implemented based on the model predictions.
