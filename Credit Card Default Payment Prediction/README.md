# Credit Card Default Payment Prediction

## Overview
This project aims to predict credit card default payments for a bank's clients. The bank desires to increase credit card usage but is concerned about defaults and late payments. Therefore, the bank needs insights into client behavior and predictive models to identify potential defaulters. The goal is to achieve a prediction accuracy above 78%, surpassing the null accuracy, to minimize losses for both the bank and its clients.

## Dataset
- **Credit Card Default Payment Prediction.csv**: This dataset contains information about credit card clients, including demographic features, payment history, and default status.

## Objective
The primary objective is to build predictive models to identify clients likely to default on their credit card payments. The bank aims for a prediction accuracy of over 78% to mitigate financial risks associated with defaults.

## Methodology
1. **Data Preprocessing**:
   - Handle missing values.
   - Encode categorical variables.
   - Scale numerical features.

2. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**:
   - Explore distributions of features.
   - Analyze correlations between features and default status.
   - Identify key insights to inform modeling decisions.

3. **Model Building**:
   - Implement various classification algorithms, such as Logistic Regression, Random Forest, and Support Vector Machines (SVM).
   - Train the models on the preprocessed data.
   - Evaluate model performance using metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.

4. **Model Evaluation and Selection**:
   - Compare the performance of different models.
   - Select the best-performing model based on evaluation metrics.

5. **Conclusion and Recommendations**:
   - Summarize findings from the analysis.
   - Provide recommendations for the bank based on the predictive model's outcomes.

## Conclusion
Based on the analysis conducted, SVM is identified as the best model for predicting credit card defaults. However, it's important to note that no model is perfect, and there are trade-offs between false positives and false negatives. The bank should remain vigilant and regularly review default predictions to minimize financial losses and maintain client satisfaction.

## Future Work
- Explore advanced feature engineering techniques to improve model performance.
- Incorporate additional datasets or external factors that may influence credit card defaults.
- Deploy the predictive model into production for real-time predictions and monitoring.
