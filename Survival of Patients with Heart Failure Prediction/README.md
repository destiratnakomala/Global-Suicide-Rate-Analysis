# Survival of Patients with Heart Failure Prediction

## Overview
This project aims to predict the survival of patients with heart failure using machine learning techniques. The objective is to develop a predictive model that can determine whether a patient is likely to survive or not based on various medical features. By predicting patient survival, healthcare providers can better allocate resources and provide timely interventions to improve patient outcomes.

## Dataset Information
The dataset contains information about patients with heart failure and various medical features that may influence survival, including:

- **Age**: Age of the patient.
- **Anaemia**: Whether the patient has anaemia (0 for no, 1 for yes).
- **Diabetes**: Whether the patient has diabetes (0 for no, 1 for yes).
- **Ejection Fraction**: Percentage of blood leaving the heart at each contraction.
- **High Blood Pressure**: Whether the patient has high blood pressure (0 for no, 1 for yes).
- **Platelets**: Platelet count in the blood.
- **Serum Creatinine**: Level of creatinine in the blood.
- **Serum Sodium**: Level of sodium in the blood.
- **Smoking**: Whether the patient smokes (0 for no, 1 for yes).
- **Time**: Follow-up period (in days).
- **Death Event**: Whether the patient died during the follow-up period (0 for no, 1 for yes).

## Objective
The goal of this project is to build a machine learning model that can predict the likelihood of death for patients with heart failure. By accurately predicting patient survival, healthcare providers can prioritize high-risk patients for interventions and improve overall patient care.

## Methodology
1. **Data Loading and Preprocessing**:
   - Load the dataset and inspect its structure.
   - Handle missing values and perform data cleaning if necessary.
   - Split the dataset into features (X) and target variable (y).

2. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**:
   - Explore the distribution of features and target variable.
   - Identify patterns and correlations in the data.
   - Visualize the relationship between features and survival.

3. **Feature Engineering**:
   - Select relevant features for model training.
   - Encode categorical variables if necessary.
   - Scale numerical features to a standard range.

4. **Model Building**:
   - Choose appropriate machine learning algorithms for binary classification.
   - Train multiple models and evaluate their performance using cross-validation techniques.
   - Tune hyperparameters to improve model performance.

5. **Model Evaluation**:
   - Evaluate the trained models using appropriate evaluation metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.
   - Compare the performance of different models and select the best-performing one.

6. **Model Deployment**:
   - Deploy the trained model using a web application or API for real-time predictions.
   - Provide an interface for users to input patient data and receive survival predictions.

## Conclusion
Predicting the survival of patients with heart failure is critical for healthcare providers to allocate resources effectively and provide timely interventions. By leveraging machine learning techniques, we can develop accurate predictive models that help identify high-risk patients and improve patient outcomes.

## Future Work
- Explore ensemble learning techniques to further improve model performance.
- Incorporate additional medical features or external data sources for more comprehensive predictions.
- Collaborate with healthcare providers to integrate the model into clinical practice and evaluate its impact on patient care.
